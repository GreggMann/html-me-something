        <p>Let's start with Riley Breckenridge. Riley is the drummer of my favorite band Thrice. 
         Riley has been playing with Thrice since its' incarnation in 1998. 
        What impresses me about Riley's drumming is his ability to write the best part for the whole song, 
        something drummers call "staying in the pocket". He doesn't try to shine or show off as he plays. 
        He has been able to maintain his pocket through the continuous change in Thrice's discography. 
        Thrice has gone from post-hardcore in 2000 to experimental rock in 2005 to gaining a jazz influence 
        in 2009 to finally a matured grunge in 2015. Riley has been nothing short of exceptional and has been 
        a massive influence on my own drumming.</p>
        
        <h2>Chad Blackwell</h2>

        <p>Moving on to a short lived time in my life where I decided metal/hardcore music was what I wanted to play. 
        Chad Blackwell has been one of many metal drummers that played for the band Impending Doom. 
        What seperated him from the rest was his clean movement throughout the drumset at such an impressive tempo. 
        His drumming on The Serpent Servant(2009) was so clear, not only in playstyle, but also recording quality. 
        That album was a huge influence on my drumming at the time and I'll still be coming back to enjoy it in years to come.</p>
        
        <h2>Benny Greb</h2>

        <p>As I transitioned out of metal I wanted to find drummers with amazing technique. 
        As I searched I found a clever musician in Benny Greb. I found Benny by looking up technique videos on the internet. 
        Benny is one of few drummers that get invited to drum clinics, where he is given the opportunity to 
        share his technique and his mind on drumming. Following his progression has given me the inspiration
        to push further and find new sounds. I even purchased one of his signature cymbals which is made by 
        utilizing three different types of cymbal finishes.</p>
        
        <h2>JoJo Mayer</h2>

        <p>Finally, there is JoJo Mayer. JoJo is an absolute machine on the drums. 
        He is much older than the rest but surprisingly enough he plays electronic music, acoustically. 
        He has stated in interviews that although he has a very deep jazz background, when electronic music 
        and drum samples started to make waves in the music scene, he wanted to find a way to play such sounds 
        on an acoustic set. He is by far the most entertaining drummer I have heard and what I take from him 
        is his ability to improvise. He and his band NERVE never play the same set as they tour. 
        They are constantly improvising and innovating as they go, which is very impressive to say the least. 
        He makes it look so fun that part of my time as a drummer is dissecting his technique and implementing it to my own.</p>
